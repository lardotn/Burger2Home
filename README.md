# Burger2Home


Burger Home is a **school development project**.


The goal is to create a backend using PostgreSQL 14, Symfony 6 and API Platform 3, ...

A customer using a mobile application developed by another student must be able to choose and order a burger:

* Pay the order using Stripe.


And many other things ...
